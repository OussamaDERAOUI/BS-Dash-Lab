# BS-Dash-Lab
This code is a Python script that creates a web-based dashboard using the Dash framework and Plotly for data visualization. The dashboard presents information about movies from the IMDB website, specifically focusing on movies released between 2016 and 2023. The data is scraped from IMDB using web scraping techniques.

The main features of the dashboard include:

1. A table displaying the IMDB movies dataset.
2. Dropdown menus to select the metric (Rating, Metascore, or Voting) and the number of top movies to display.
3. A bar chart showing the top movies based on the selected metric.
4. A pie chart representing the total number of movies grouped by year.
5. A radio chart that allows you to choose between 'Rating', 'Voting', and 'Metascore' to display the average scores by year.

**To run this code, make sure you have the necessary packages installed, including Dash, Plotly, pandas, bs4 (BeautifulSoup), and requests. You may need to update the Dash and Plotly packages to their latest versions.

Please note that web scraping can be subject to legal and ethical considerations. Make sure you comply with the terms of service of the website you are scraping and respect the website's data usage policies.
